# T-Bot
The source for a "bot" made by me.


A simple python bot that will open specified links in specified discord channel id's. This bot opens the link into a browser window on detection and can be toggled on and off.

Set up a discord application at https://discord.com/developers/applications for the bot to work (This is the token you will be inputting)
